# SideScroller
This is a Simple Sidescroller made in pygame python with interface elements created in Tkinter.
**To Play:**  go to the .dist folder and open the exe file.
**To Make Changes :** Requirements - i) Python 3
                                     ii) pip
                                     iii) A code editor (preferably Vscode)
                                     iv) PIL (install through console using 'pip install Pillow')
                                     v) pygame (install through console using 'pip install pygame')
                                     vi) Tkinter, It ships with python 3
                                     vii) PyInstaller for updating the exe (Windows only) ( install through console using 'pip install pyinstaller') 
                                     
                       After making the changes to code, for it to reflect in the exe, we've to run 'python -m PyInstaller --onefile game.py' then it builds the exe again...
